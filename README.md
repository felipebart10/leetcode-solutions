# leetcode-solutions

Hello, i'm Felipe aka felipebart10, a former civil engineer trying to make my way on programming. I've started studying another college degree on computer science field and started experimentating with Python. Note that I'm still learning, playing with logic problems with lists and objects. While I am one of the best students at my class, I acknowledge that I've plenty to learn from more experienced people so I'm starting my journey here at github with this basic problem solving repo. I expect to create personal projects on the near future, related with brazilian soccer and (for my final paper) a hair sallon ERP-like system.
